Employed different pre-trained models like VGG19, InceptionNet and ResNet which are trained on Imagenet dataset with 1000 classes and compared 
their performance for classifying CIFAR10 dataset which has 10 classes.

Also compared these pre-trained models with the fine-tuned model.

Technologies used: Python, Pytorch,Matplotlib
